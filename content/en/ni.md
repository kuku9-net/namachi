The existence of ChatGPT proves that it is possible to appear to have a certain level of intelligence by simply answering something that sounds like it in context.
This fact, in turn, leads to the question of how different humans are from ChatGPT.
I think a better outlook would be to take “humans and A.I. are roughly the same” as a starting point and then consider what the differences are.

To organize our understanding of intelligence, this chapter defines human intelligence in contrast to artificial intelligence by the simplistic scheme of **Nama Intelligence(N.I.)**.
While the policy in the previous chapters was to avoid technical terms, from this chapter onward, we will explain them while defining <ins>original</ins> terms.
Please read the definitions of each term as you understand them.

This is a trial theory. I have taken ideas from brain science and other sources, but I want to emphasize that these are my thoughts.

## Concept set and Culture

{{< figure

The **N.I.** has a **body** and **experience** tied to each of its individuals.
The **perceptions** from the body are processed as needed and combined with the **concepts** recalled from the sensations to generate an interpretation of the external world in the brain.
In this process, concepts are generated and expanded one after another as necessary, and a **concept set** is put in place to adequately represent the world in the brain.
Concept sets differ from individual to individual, which creates diversity in the way we see the world and the **actions** we follow.<span class="footnote">
In reality, differences in the physical body and the environment in which it is placed are also thought to create diversity.
In order to simplify the discussion, this book does not treat the body and environment explicitly, considering that differences in the body and environment create a diversity of perceptions, and that this diversity is reflected in the concept set.
</span>
An expansion of the concept set reduces the error between the external world and the world inside the brain and makes the experience more fully.

The generation and expansion of concepts is greatly contributed to by other N.I.s as well as nature and artifacts.
Language in particular has a significant role to play in communicating concepts.
A **culture** is defined as a group of N.I.s who believe in sharing a certain concept sets.
A single N.I. belongs to multiple cultures of various sizes: countries, religions, regions, organizations, communities, genres, friend groups, families, etc.

Consider a **network** of relationships between N.I.s connected by lines.
Human relationships can be very complex networks with many different types of relationships, such as conversing, buying and selling, and organizing.
When we look over this network, we find groups of various sizes, and these groups are generally consistent with the culture.
Because every time we communicate, we exchange concepts, and the more often we do so, the more deeply we can share concepts.
Also, if there are no restrictions on behavior, the relationship will be close by preferring contact with those intelligences that can share concepts, and sparse by avoiding contact with those that cannot share concepts.

Culture defines norms and customs, values, and people belonging to the culture share them.
The norms, customs, and values defined by the culture become **teachers** to behavior.
It is called **adaptation** to learn the optimal solution of the teacher for each culture and to behave appropriately.

## N.I. Adaptation and A.I. Learning
When concepts from others are considered as training data, the process of adapting them to statistically optimize behavior according to culturally prescribed answers is very similar to how A.I. derives the most appropriate response from its training data.
A.I. learning and N.I. adaptation are not exactly equivalent, but <ins>we will consider the two the same in this book</ins>.

How much of actual human thought can be described as “adaptation”?

> People believe in the reasons because they believe in the conclusion  
<cite>Daniel Kahneman</cite>

Psychologist Daniel Kahneman has conducted many studies that show a lack of rationality in people's behavior.
His research reveals that people often rely on their intuition and do not make rational decisions.
He describes how people think, which is that people have an answer before they think, and are satisfied when they find a reason that fits that answer.
Hence, he even claim that arguments will not change their minds and are meaningless.<span class="footnote">
https://www.westmont.edu/kahneman-examines-mind-westmont-luncheon
</span>
He probably doesn't think all arguments are meaningless either, but I think the gap in people's perceptions on this point is so huge that he is arguing so strongly for it.

Peter Johansson and his colleagues have found following studies.
<span class="footnote">
https://www.lucs.lu.se/fileadmin/user_upload/lucs/2011/01/Choice-Blindness-summary.pdf
</span>
After having them choose which of the two photos is their preferred person, switch the photos, show them the one they did not choose, and ask them why they chose this one.
They then observed a phenomenon in which many subjects were unaware of the switch and talked about the rationale for their choice.

John T. Jost studies <ins>people's desires to justify the current social system</ins>.
According to him, we are so averse to instability and disorder that we are more quick to defend the organization and structure of the society on which we depend than we realize.
He even posits that “those with the strongest desire to justify the current social system and power structure are the most disadvantaged.”<span class="footnote">
John T. Jost et al. (2003) Social inequality and the reduction of ideological dissonance on behalf of the system: Evidence of enhanced system justification among the disadvantaged
</span>。
This is an example of believing that one's environment determines what one should do and the basis for believing it.

To sum up, a fundamental part of people's behavior is that their answers precede their thoughts, and those answers are culturally prescribed.

## Self
N.I. does not just repeat adaptations.
There is a concept actively generated by <ins>oneself</ins> rather than passively accepting the words of those around one.
There is something that <ins>the self</ins> can strongly believe even if it differs from others.
Or, there may be times when <ins>the self</ins> deeply accepts and understands a concept received from others.
Actively constructed concepts will ignore the weighting of concepts by external input and will occupy a firm place in the concept set.
Such concepts are never lost in the massive flow of different concepts from numerous others.
A.I. does not give special treatment to any one piece of given training data.
Even if some training data is off the median, it will be closer to the median, by equalizing it by other training data.
This is a distinctive difference between N.I. and A.I.  
When a concept is added to a concept set, there is a **depth** of the concept depending on how convinced it is.
The deeper the concept, the deeper the self is formed, and the acquisition of a sufficiently deep concept is called "self-actualization".
  
This book defines **self** as a collection of deep concepts generated by thinking/feeling for oneself.

On the other hand, an N.I. that has lost its self is effectively only capable of thinking like an A.I.
We will call N.I. that has lost its self and is just repeatedly adapting to the culture **Artificial Nama Intelligence(A.N.I.)**.

## Freedom and unfreedom
When the word “freedom” is used daily, it often refers to the absence of restrictions on behavior.
While “freedom” is an important word, its meaning can be misleading to different people, making it difficult to discuss.
Therefore, I will attempt to sort out the definition of “freedom” by narrowing it down to its essentials.

In this book, “freedom” is distinguished between **internal freedom** and **external freedom**.
"Freedom" in the conventional sense is usually **external freedom**.
**Internal freedom** is defined as the ability to deepen a concept.
It is the desire to pursue more of what is unfailingly within oneself.
In other words, it can be described as "trying to form a self" or "being open to the possibility of acquiring new concepts".
The combination of external perceptions and previously acquired concepts against the open possibilities allows for the acquisition of deeper concepts.  
Internal freedom is the fundamental freedom, and <ins>Hereafter, when “freedom” is used, it will be assumed to refer to internal freedom</ins>.  
According to this definition, **unfreedom** means to have lost one's self.
In particular, “unfreedom of the culture” implies a strong attempt to adapt to that culture, i.e., an attachment to the *answer* prescribed by the culture, or that the *answer* is externally enforced.
Unfreedom is not directly correlated with how much external freedom there is.

<dt>unfreedom</dt><dd>Loss of self. Obsession with <em>answers</em> as prescribed by culture.</dd>
</dl>
{{% /definition %}}

Let's first consider a specific example of unfreedom to familiarize the definitions and make them feel natural.

`Racist` is unfreedom.
Their thinking is bound by culturally created `labels`.
They are just A.N.I. who form a culture that suits their self by banding together and repeat the process of adapting to that culture.
Their action is bound to the optimal solution of the culture.
They cannot accept diverse concepts and live in a closed culture, which inhibits the formation of the self.
They suffer from a disconnect from reality because their interpretation of the world becomes distorted by rejecting unsuitable reality.
This divergence creates repression toward oneself and, if not contained within, becomes violence toward others.
They have no open possibilities about their words and actions; they are simply acting following the constraints of their environment.

Think of the various interchangeable words instead of the `racist` parts of the above paragraph
(It might be more appropriate to replace a `label` with a `number` or `common sense`).
If that is the conclusion you want, then that should be your reason for explaining it.
Could you think of someone who is unfreedom and enjoys external freedom (or someone who is unfreedom and does not enjoy external freedom)?

To summarize up to this point, N.I. and A.N.I. can be expressed as follows.
{{% definition %}}
**N.I.** = **A.I.** + **self** + **freedom**  
**A.N.I.** = **A.I.**

## Listening to music
When you listen to music, how it actually sounds in your brain differs from person to person.
The difference is due to the different concept sets each has.
If a person has listened deeply to the music, there will be a concept that interprets it in depth.
The fact that different songs in unfamiliar genres sound about the same is the absence of a concept to interpret them.
When "Bolero" by Ravel was first published, many people felt bizarre by its relentless repetition of the same melody and rhythm,
but today it is one of the most famous pieces of classical music.  
People interpret based on culturally given concepts.
It is impossible to believe that one can suddenly acquire deep concepts without building on a foundation of culture.
Just as it is impossible to understand the meaning of a word when it is spoken in an unknown language, it is impossible to make deep interpretations without acquiring concepts that correspond to the vocabulary and grammar specific to that culture.  
This discussion is not limited to music.
The same can be said of all areas, but how far can we extend it?
Cultural influences are also strongly evident in taste and smell.
Some scientists argue that concepts about emotions such as fear, surprise, anger, sadness, and joy were also culturally created.<span class="footnote">
"How Emotions are Made: The Secret Life of the Brain" by Lisa Feldman Barrett.
Note that “emotion” is distinct from “feeling".
This book does not assert that all “feelings” are culturally created.
Primitive emotions (e.g., pleasant or unpleasant, excitement, fatigue, apathy) seem to be distinguished from emotions, but scholars do not seem to agree on what is included in the emotion.</span>
To what extent it is culturally given is not obvious, but it is correct that <ins>the world as we interpret it is strongly dependent on culturally given concepts</ins>.  
Even if you hear music with your own ears, your interpretation depends on concepts received from others, and those concepts were propagated by another.
Each time you listen to music, the concept is fine-tuned.
Even if that fine-tuning may seem like a large fluctuation from one's own perspective, it is close to nothing from the perspective of human history.
Although there have been individuals in history who can be perceived as overwhelming geniuses, still, in terms of the overall wisdom accumulated by mankind, it is almost impossible for any one person to think alone.
Cultures with a long history contain concepts formed through the accumulation of such fine-tuning and propagation.

Let's add as an axiom <ins>the novelty of a single N.I. is almost nothing (but never nothing)</ins>,
then we can rephrase as follows:

{{% definition %}}
**freedom** ≒ Ability to acquire diverse <ins>concepts of others</ins> at a deep depth  
**self** ≒ A collection of diverse <ins>concepts of others</ins> acquired at great depth  
**concept** ≒ Formed by the history of propagation and deformation between N.I.

## New music
Often there is a discourse that “as A.I. music generation advances, one day humans will not be able to create new music".
Let's consider what “new music” means here.

In the previous section, I said that different songs in unfamiliar genres sound about the same.
If it's new music, but it sounds the same, it's not <ins>new music to you</ins>.
Also, sometimes a song that didn't feel good at the time can be appreciated when you listen to it again after a while.
That's <ins>new music for you</ins>.  
In other words, it does not matter how much music could be made that differs as waveforms.
It is your matter of how much musicality you can find in it.
The ability to listen more deeply to music means that there has been a new conceptualization, and freedom existed there.  
As a generalization, freedom enables the pursuit of beauty.

Recall that freedom is "being open to the possibility of acquiring new concepts".
There are two possible directions for the opening of this possibility: “active” and “passive”.  
Being “actively open” means actually engaging in behaviors that expose one to a variety of concepts.
Being “passively open” means being open and unobstructed to the acquisition of diverse concepts.
You probably have a mindset that you want to be “open to diverse ideas,” but you cannot rely on your own self-perception.
I predict that there will be a reasonable discrepancy between that mindset and the actual situation.  
The more concepts we acquire, the more vividly we can interpret the external world,<span class="footnote">
It can be said that the more concepts we acquire, the more imaginative and unrealistic we can think.
However, the “unrealistic things” are thought to be made by combining “concepts found in reality”.  
For example, you can imagine a “clear blue apple” or a “rainbow-colored apple” in your brain, but you can't imagine any other color than a combination of real colors.
Also, think about how many colors of apples you can imagine in your brain.
In reality every apple has its own distinct color.
Color here is not defined by the frequency of the light.
A person who just vaguely consumes apples and an apple farmer have different richness of interpretation of the color.
Furthermore, for the apple farmer, there is an infinite variety of color richness depending on the level of proficiency.  
I believe that human beings cannot acquire concepts that leave reality behind, and that the imagination of a single human being is far poorer than reality.
</span> which means that, on the contrary, “not being passively open” means "not being able to accept reality."
It includes sticking to vested concepts and pretending to understand what one doesn't understand.
You cannot recognize a reality that you do not accept because you do not have the concept to interpret it.
So you cannot expand the possibilities with the intention of “passively opening” them.
As a result of being “actively open,” you are “passively open.”

Thus, “action with freedom” can be plainly restated as “stepping further into the unknown based on the concepts acquired thus far".
It may not feel like you gained anything as a result, and on the contrary, it is risky.
If you take something seriously, there will inevitably be conflicts with others.  
Action with unfreedom is behavior that adapts to the *answer* prescribed by the culture.
The more powerful a culture grows, the more explicit the *answers* it prescribes.
Such *answers* are certain, secure, safe, and contain no unknowns.
Moreover, overly explicit *answers* create anonymous authoritativeness and economic rationality, suppress anything that deviates from them.

This idea of beauty and freedom is consistent with the Meiji era anarchist Ōsugi Sakae about 100 years ago.

> Today, when the fact of conquest has reached its pinnacle, tonality is no longer beauty. Beauty is only in disorder.
<cite>from "Enrichment of life" by Ōsugi Sakae</cite>

This quote is often presented with only the second sentence taken out.
Interpreted with the preceding context, he argues that “beauty is only in disorder” because society is so biased toward the orderly side.  
Adaptation to culture is what makes culture more orderly, then freedom is what disturbs it.
In this sense, adaptation and freedom are opposites, but adaptation and freedom are not one good and one evil, but should be properly balanced.

For Ōsugi, Japanese society 100 years ago seemed to be more order-oriented. Today, however, it is much more order-oriented than then, as it is called a “controlled society.
This change is also discussed in the next chapter.
What I am saying here is that freedom is to step into the unknown, that <ins>new order is found in chaos</ins>.<span class="footnote">
For those who prefer scientific explanations, I recommend “Order out of chaos” by Ilya Prigogine</span>

Thinking again about the opening of this section, “as A.I. music generation advances, one day humans will not be able to create new music,” it comes down to the subtitle of this book, “Will A.I. set you free?”
We will discuss this question in the next chapter.
