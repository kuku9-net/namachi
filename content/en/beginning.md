A.I. is attracting a great deal of attention as of 2024, led by the rise of ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, Inc.
If you have tried conversing with an A.I., you may have been surprised to find that it responds as if it were a real human being.
Only a short time ago, human thought was considered complex and not easily realized.
Despite this, an A.I. was created that was able to converse reasonably.  
Current A.I. has a much simpler structure than the human brain.
However, computers never forget and repeat monotonous tasks without hesitation, no matter how much they have to do. ChatGPT was born from this ability to read vast amounts of text.

This book assumes that human thinking and current A.I. thinking are <ins>almost</ins> the same.
To illustrate the similarities and differences, human intelligence is organized by defining of the “nama<span class="footnote">
nama is written as 生 in Japanese, which means raw, life, birth, growth, and so on.
</span> intelligence” scheme.
Finally the impact of A.I. will be discussed.

It consists of the following three chapters:

Chapter 1: Artificial Intelligence  
This chapter outlines the current trends in A.I. as of 2024. While avoiding technical details, the presentation will explain the past, present, and future of A.I., emphasizing points that need to be kept in mind when considering its social impact.

Chapter 2: Nama Intelligence  
In this chapter, we will define nama intelligence and describe its similarities and differences with A.I. It also organizes the question, “What is self?" and "What is freedom?” This organization will reveal that the network of nama intelligence is essential in shaping the person.

Chapter 3: Nama Intelligence and Artificial (Nama) Intelligence  
We will discuss a society in which artificial intelligence is added to the network of nama intelligence, and consider the question, “Will A.I. set you free?”
